# Blockchain-client
A blockchain built using Node js/Go
The blockchain was supposed to reach the commercial stage in collaboration with one of the programming groups, which was canceled.
I decided to make the source public, so that if anyone wanted to use it.

client-side source  -> [Blockchain-client](https://github.com/hamidreza01/Blockchain-client)
